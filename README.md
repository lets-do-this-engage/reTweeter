# reTweeter
Small PHP script written for 'The Worst Fans' that will automatically retweet any tweets (but not retweets or replies) that the 3 members of the group tweet.

8/15/20 - added ability to define channels and keywords so that if anyone in the group tweets a keyword, that tweet will be retweeted by a specific TheWorstfans twitter account channel.

For example, if JT Kirkman tweets the word MMA, that tweet will be retweeted by @TheWorstFansMMA
